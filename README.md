Project Definitions:
Develop Project which can control LED, measure temperature, measure battery voltage which are connected on stm board. Use mobile brower to control that board LED. and same browser page will be display temperature and voltage value. Use ESP8266 Serial WIFI module (ESP-01), bread board, STM-dev board, temperature sensor, 9V battery, LED, resistor etc. to make you board.
